![Payymo Logo](generated-icon.png)

Payymo is a comprehensive payment integration for WHMCS that combines the power of Open Banking (via GoCardless) and Stripe to automate payment reconciliation, reduce manual work, and improve cash flow.

## Overview

Payymo connects your WHMCS installation to over 2400 banks via the GoCardless Open Banking API and integrates with Stripe to provide a complete payment reconciliation solution. The system automatically matches incoming bank transactions and Stripe payments with unpaid invoices in WHMCS, saving you hours of manual reconciliation work.

### Key Features

- **Bank Connectivity**: Connect to over 2400 banks across Europe via GoCardless
- **Stripe Integration**: Retrieve and reconcile Stripe payments with WHMCS invoices
- **Automatic Matching**: Advanced algorithm matches transactions to invoices using reference, amount, date, and client information
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each match is assigned a confidence score to help identify reliable matches
- **Manual Review**: Review and approve/reject suggested matches with a simple interface
- **Detailed Reporting**: Get insights into your payment reconciliation process
- **Secure OAuth Flow**: Connect to banks and Stripe using secure OAuth connections
- **Webhook Integration**: Receive real-time updates from GoCardless via secure certificate-verified webhooks
- **WHMCS Admin Interface**: Manage everything from within your WHMCS admin area

## Components

The Payymo integration consists of two main components:

1. **WHMCS Addon Module**: Integrates directly into your WHMCS installation, providing a user interface for managing connections, viewing transactions, and handling matches.

2. **Backend Service**: Python-based Flask application that handles communication with GoCardless and Stripe APIs, stores transaction data, and performs the matching algorithm.
