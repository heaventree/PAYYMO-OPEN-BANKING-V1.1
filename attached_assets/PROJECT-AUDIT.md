## 🎯 Objective
Conduct a critical, hostile-grade review of the entire development system. This includes a forensic analysis of structure, practices, and enforcement protocols using the mindset of a senior architect with 40+ years experience.

## 🧩 Audit Scope

### Global System Review

- Score for token efficiency, readability, modularity
- Break down any security shortcomings
- Identify bloat, overengineering, or sloppy logic

### 🔐 Security Evaluation
- OAuth, JWT, CSRF/XSS resistance
- LocalStorage/IndexedDB encryption
