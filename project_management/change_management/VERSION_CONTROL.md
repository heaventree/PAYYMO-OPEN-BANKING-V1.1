# Payymo Version Control Strategy

## Introduction

This document defines the version control strategy for the Payymo project, establishing consistent practices for managing code, documentation, and configuration changes throughout the project lifecycle. A robust version control strategy is essential for maintaining project integrity, facilitating collaboration, supporting traceability, and enabling efficient development workflows.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this version control strategy are to:

1. Establish clear procedures for managing code and documentation changes
2. Define branching and merging strategies that support parallel development
3. Implement versioning schemes that communicate change significance
4. Enable traceability between requirements, changes, and code
5. Facilitate efficient code reviews and quality assurance
6. Support release management and deployment processes
7. Maintain comprehensive history for audit and compliance purposes
8. Provide robust recovery mechanisms for code and documentation

## Source Code Management

### Git as Version Control System

Payymo uses Git as its primary version control system for all project assets, including:
- Application source code
- Documentation
- Configuration files
- Database schema definitions
- Test scripts and data
- Build and deployment scripts

### Repository Structure

#### Repository Organization

The project maintains separate repositories for different system components:

1. **payymo-backend**: Core application backend services
2. **payymo-frontend**: User interface components and frontend code
3. **payymo-whmcs-module**: WHMCS integration module
4. **payymo-docs**: Project documentation
5. **payymo-infrastructure**: Infrastructure as code and deployment scripts

#### Standard Directory Structure

Each repository follows a standardized structure to ensure consistency:

```
/
├── src/                  # Source code
├── tests/                # Test code and resources
├── docs/                 # Component-specific documentation
├── config/               # Configuration files
├── scripts/              # Build and utility scripts
├── .github/              # GitHub-specific files (workflows, templates)
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore patterns
├── README.md             # Repository overview
├── CHANGELOG.md          # Change history
└── LICENSE               # License information
```

### Branching Strategy

Payymo employs a Git Flow-based branching strategy adapted for our specific needs:

#### Primary Branches

1. **main**
   - Production-ready code
   - Always in a deployable state
   - Protected branch requiring pull request and approvals
   - Tagged with release versions

2. **develop**
   - Integration branch for features
   - Contains latest development work
   - Source for feature branches
   - Continuously integrated and tested

#### Supporting Branches

3. **feature/[feature-name]**
   - Created from: develop
   - Merged back to: develop
   - Naming convention: feature/[issue-id]-descriptive-name
   - Used for new feature development
   - One branch per feature or user story

4. **release/[version]**
   - Created from: develop
   - Merged to: main and develop
   - Naming convention: release/v1.2.3
   - Used for release preparation
   - Only bug fixes, documentation, and release preparation

5. **hotfix/[fix-name]**
   - Created from: main
   - Merged to: main and develop
   - Naming convention: hotfix/[issue-id]-descriptive-name
   - Used for urgent production fixes
   - Deployed immediately after testing

6. **bugfix/[bug-name]**
   - Created from: develop
   - Merged back to: develop
   - Naming convention: bugfix/[issue-id]-descriptive-name
   - Used for non-urgent bug fixes

#### Branch Lifetime

- **feature/**, **bugfix/**: Typically 1-2 weeks, not exceeding one sprint
- **release/**: Short-lived, typically 1-3 days
- **hotfix/**: Very short-lived, typically hours to 1 day
- **develop**, **main**: Permanent branches

### Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Message Format

Commit messages follow a standardized format to ensure clarity and traceability:

```
[type]: [summary]

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Where:
- **type**: Indicates the kind of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- **summary**: Brief description of the change (50 chars max, present tense)
- **body**: Detailed explanation of the change
- **footer**: References to issues, breaking changes, etc.

#### Commit Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples

```
feat: add multi-currency support to transaction matching

Implemented the ability to match transactions across different currencies
by adding automatic currency conversion based on daily exchange rates.

Resolves: PAYM-123
```

```
fix: prevent duplicate transaction processing

Added transaction ID verification before processing to ensure
the same transaction isn't processed multiple times.

Fixes: PAYM-456
```

#### Atomic Commits

Commits should be atomic, meaning they:
- Focus on a single logical change
- Include all necessary changes to implement that logical unit
- Have tests where applicable
- Leave the system in a working state

### Pull Request Process

#### Creation Guidelines

1. Create pull request from feature branch to target branch
2. Include comprehensive description of changes
3. Reference related issues
4. Include testing instructions
5. Add relevant reviewers

#### Required Information

Each pull request includes:
- Purpose of the change
- Related requirements or user stories
- Test approach and results
- Screenshots or videos for UI changes
- Migration steps if applicable
- Special deployment considerations

#### Review Process

1. Automated checks run on pull request creation
2. At least two reviewers required for approval
3. Code owner approval required for critical areas
4. All comments must be addressed
5. CI/CD pipeline must pass

#### Merge Guidelines

1. Pull request must have required approvals
2. All discussions must be resolved
3. CI/CD pipeline must pass
4. No merge conflicts
5. Squash merging preferred for feature branches
6. Merge commit for release and hotfix branches

## Versioning Scheme

### Semantic Versioning

Payymo follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for all software releases:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]
```

Where:
- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes
- **PRERELEASE**: Optional tag for pre-release versions (alpha, beta, rc)
- **BUILD**: Optional build metadata

Examples:
- 1.0.0: Initial release
- 1.1.0: Feature addition
- 1.1.1: Bug fix
- 2.0.0: Breaking change
- 1.2.0-alpha.1: Alpha pre-release
- 1.2.0-beta.2: Beta pre-release
- 1.2.0-rc.1: Release candidate

### Version Incrementing Rules

1. **MAJOR**:
   - Breaking API changes
   - Incompatible database schema changes
   - Significant UI overhauls affecting user workflow
   - Changes requiring user retraining

2. **MINOR**:
   - New features with backward compatibility
   - Significant performance improvements
   - Deprecation of features (but not removal)
   - Substantial refactoring without breaking changes

3. **PATCH**:
   - Bug fixes
   - Security patches
   - Minor performance optimizations
   - Documentation updates
   - Non-functional code improvements

### Documentation Versioning

Documentation follows a parallel versioning scheme:

1. **Technical Documentation**: Versioned with the software
2. **User Documentation**: Versioned with the software major/minor versions
3. **Process Documentation**: Dated with version number (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)

## Release Management

### Release Types

Payymo defines several release types:

1. **Major Release**: Significant new functionality or breaking changes
2. **Minor Release**: New features with backward compatibility
3. **Patch Release**: Bug fixes and minor improvements
4. **Hotfix**: Urgent fix for production issues
5. **Alpha/Beta Release**: Pre-release for testing and feedback

### Release Cadence

- **Minor Releases**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Patch Releases**: Every 2-3 weeks as needed
- **Hotfixes**: As needed, deployed immediately
- **Major Releases**: 2-3 times per year, scheduled

### Release Artifacts

Each release produces the following artifacts:

1. **Tagged Code**: Git tag on main branch
2. **Release Notes**: Detailed description of changes
3. **Deployment Package**: Ready-to-deploy software
4. **Documentation Update**: Updated documentation
5. **Database Migration Scripts**: If applicable

### Release Process

1. **Release Planning**:

   - Documentation planning

2. **Release Preparation**:
   - Create release branch from develop
   - Update version numbers
   - Finalize documentation
   - Final testing and bug fixing
   - Generate release notes

3. **Release Approval**:
   - QA sign-off
   - Product Owner approval
   - Security review if applicable
   - Final deployment approval

4. **Release Deployment**:
   - Merge release branch to main
   - Create version tag
   - Deploy to production
   - Merge release branch back to develop

5. **Post-Release Activities**:
   - Monitor for issues
   - User communication
   - Knowledge base updates

## Tagging Strategy

### Tag Format

Tags follow a standardized format:

```
v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH][-PRERELEASE][+BUILD]
```

Examples:
- v1.0.0
- v1.1.0
- v1.1.1
- v2.0.0
- v1.2.0-alpha.1
- v1.2.0-beta.2
- v1.2.0-rc.1

### Tagging Process

1. Tags created for all releases and significant pre-releases
2. Tags must be signed (using GPG) by authorized release manager
3. Tags created only on protected branches (main)
4. Tag message includes summary of changes
5. Tags linked to detailed release notes

### Tag Management

1. Tags are immutable once published
2. Tags are never deleted
3. If issues discovered, new tags are created
4. Release tags are pushed to all repository mirrors

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Configuration management follows these principles:

1. Configuration separated from code
2. Environment-specific configurations stored separately
3. Sensitive configuration values stored in secure parameter store
4. Configuration templates in version control
5. Configuration validation process before deployment

### Configuration Storage

Different types of configuration stored in appropriate locations:

1. **Application Configuration**:
   - Templates in version control
   - Actual values in parameter store

2. **Infrastructure Configuration**:
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in version control
   - Terraform state in secure backend

3. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Deployment scripts in version control
   - Environment-specific values in parameter store

## Documentation Version Control

### Documentation Types

Different types of documentation managed in version control:

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Generated from code comments
   - Versioned with the software

2. **Technical Documentation**:
   - Architecture documents
   - Development guides
   - Operations manuals

3. **User Documentation**:
   - User guides
   - Administrator guides
   - Training materials

### Documentation Formats

Documentation maintained in these formats:

1. **Markdown**: For most technical documentation
2. **OpenAPI/Swagger**: For API documentation
3. **HTML/CSS**: For published documentation
4. **PDF**: For stable documentation releases

### Documentation Workflow

1. Documentation changes follow same branch strategy as code
2. Documentation reviewed as part of pull requests
3. Major documentation updates may have separate branches
4. Documentation built and published with each release

## Build and Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

Version control integrated with CI/CD pipeline:

1. Automated builds triggered on commit to any branch
2. Comprehensive test suite run on all branches
3. Additional validation on pull requests
4. Deployment automation for approved releases
5. Version information injected into builds

### Build Artifacts

Build artifacts versioned and stored:

1. Build number incorporated into version metadata
2. All builds archived with version information
3. Release builds stored in artifact repository
4. Artifacts linked to source code version

## Backup and Recovery

### Repository Backup Strategy

Complete backup strategy for version control:

1. Regular repository backup (minimum daily)
2. Backup retention policy (90 days minimum)
3. Periodic full backup verification
4. Off-site backup copy
5. Disaster recovery procedure documented and tested

### Repository Mirroring

Repository mirroring for redundancy:

1. Primary repository with authenticated access
2. Read-only mirror for backup access
3. Regular synchronization verification
4. Automatic failover capability

## Access Control and Security

### Repository Access Levels

Clearly defined access levels:

1. **Administrator**: Full repository control (limited to DevOps leads)
2. **Maintainer**: Manage branches and releases (tech leads)
3. **Developer**: Push to development branches (developers)
4. **Reporter**: Create issues and pull requests (QA, stakeholders)
5. **Guest**: View code only (other stakeholders)

### Protected Resources

The following are protected resources:

1. **main branch**: Requires pull request and approvals
2. **develop branch**: Requires pull request and at least one approval
3. **release branches**: Requires release manager approval
4. **version tags**: Can only be created by release managers
