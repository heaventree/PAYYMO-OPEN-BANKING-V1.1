# Payymo Change Control Process

## Introduction

This document establishes a formal process for managing changes to the Payymo project. The Change Control Process provides a structured approach to evaluating, approving, implementing, and documenting changes to ensure project integrity, minimize disruption, and maintain alignment with project objectives.

Change control is critical for a financial application like Payymo where stability, security, and reliability are paramount. This process applies to changes in requirements, design, code, documentation, and infrastructure throughout the project lifecycle.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this Change Control Process are to:

1. Provide a systematic approach to handling change requests
2. Ensure thorough impact analysis before changes are approved
3. Maintain appropriate approval levels based on change significance
4. Document changes and their rationales for future reference
5. Communicate changes effectively to all stakeholders
6. Minimize disruption to project progress
7. Prevent scope creep and maintain project focus
8. Ensure changes align with project goals and quality standards

## Change Categories

Changes are categorized based on their impact and scope:

### Category 1: Minor Change
- Minimal impact on project scope, schedule, or budget
- No effect on system architecture or design
- Limited to small functionality enhancements or fixes
- Examples: UI text changes, simple bug fixes, documentation updates

### Category 2: Significant Change
- Moderate impact on project scope, schedule, or budget
- May affect multiple components but within existing architecture
- Requires cross-team coordination
- Examples: Adding new features within scope, API modifications, database changes

### Category 3: Major Change
- Substantial impact on project scope, schedule, or budget
- Affects system architecture or fundamental design elements
- Requires extensive re-planning and resource allocation
- Examples: Adding major functionality, changing core architecture, integration with new systems

### Category 4: Critical Change
- Fundamental impact on project direction, timeline, or viability
- Affects project foundations or core business objectives
- Requires executive-level review and approval
- Examples: Changing primary project objectives, major technology platform changes
