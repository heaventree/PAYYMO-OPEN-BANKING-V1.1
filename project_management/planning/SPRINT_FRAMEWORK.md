# Payymo Agile Sprint Framework

## Introduction

This document establishes a structured approach to agile sprint planning and execution for the Payymo project. It defines the processes, roles, ceremonies, and artifacts necessary to implement an effective agile methodology that balances flexibility with predictability. The framework is designed to support the overall project goals while enabling iterative development and continuous improvement.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this Agile Sprint Framework are to:

1. Establish a consistent approach to sprint planning and execution
2. Define clear roles and responsibilities for the agile process
3. Structure ceremonies that facilitate collaboration and transparency
4. Create artifacts that support planning, tracking, and improvement
5. Enable continuous delivery of high-quality increments
6. Support data-driven decision making through metrics
7. Facilitate continuous improvement through retrospection

## Agile Methodology

Payymo adopts a hybrid agile approach based on Scrum with elements of Kanban to support both iterative development and continuous flow:

### Core Principles

1. **Iterative Development**: Building the product incrementally through time-boxed sprints
2. **Empirical Process Control**: Using transparency, inspection, and adaptation
3. **Self-Organization**: Empowering teams to determine how to accomplish their work
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular reflection and adaptation of processes
5. **Value Delivery**: Focus on delivering business value in each sprint
6. **Technical Excellence**: Maintaining high quality standards and reducing technical debt
7. **Sustainable Pace**: Working at a consistent, maintainable velocity

### Sprint Structure

- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (10 working days)
- **Sprint Cadence**: Consistent start and end days (Monday to Friday)
- **Working Hours**: Core hours 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM daily for collaboration

## Estimation Approach

### Story Point Estimation
- Relative sizing using modified Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20)
- Based on complexity, uncertainty, and effort
- Conducted using Planning Poker technique
- Team consensus required for final estimate
- No correlation to time units (hours/days)

#### Estimation Guidelines
- **1 Point**: Very simple, well-understood, minimal risk
- **2 Points**: Simple, mostly understood, slight risk
- **3 Points**: Moderate complexity, some unknowns
- **5 Points**: Complex, significant unknowns
- **8 Points**: Very complex, many unknowns
- **13 Points**: Extremely complex, consider breaking down
- **20 Points**: Too large, must be broken down

### Task Breakdown
- Sprint backlog items broken down into tasks
- Tasks estimated in hours (1-8 hour range)
- Tasks should represent a single person's work
- Maximum task size of 8 hours (larger tasks split further)
- All team members participate in task creation
