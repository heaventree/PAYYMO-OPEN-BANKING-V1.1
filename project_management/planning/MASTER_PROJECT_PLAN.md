# Payymo Master Project Plan

## Introduction

This Master Project Plan provides a comprehensive framework for planning, executing, and monitoring the Payymo project. It defines the work breakdown structure, resource allocation, dependencies, and timeline necessary to successfully deliver the Payymo financial reconciliation platform. This document serves as the central reference for project planning and execution guidance.

## Project Overview

### Project Purpose

Payymo is a multi-tenant SaaS solution that automates financial reconciliation between banking systems and payment processors, specifically designed for integration with WHMCS. The platform connects with GoCardless (Open Banking) and Stripe to retrieve transaction data, match it to WHMCS invoices, and provide comprehensive financial visibility and reporting.

### Project Objectives

1. Develop a secure, multi-tenant platform for financial reconciliation
2. Create intelligent transaction matching with 95%+ accuracy
3. Integrate with GoCardless for Open Banking connectivity
4. Integrate with Stripe for payment processing
5. Implement WHMCS module for seamless integration
6. Provide comprehensive financial dashboards and reporting
7. Enable white-labeling for tenant customization

### Project Scope

**In Scope:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- GoCardless Open Banking integration
- Stripe payment processing integration
- WHMCS module development
- Financial dashboard and reporting
- Transaction matching engine
- User authentication and authorization
- White-labeling capabilities

**Out of Scope:**
