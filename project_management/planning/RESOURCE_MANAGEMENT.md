# Payymo Resource Management Framework

## Introduction

This Resource Management Framework establishes a comprehensive approach to planning, allocating, and optimizing resources throughout the Payymo project lifecycle. It provides structured processes for resource forecasting, capacity planning, skill management, and resource utilization tracking to ensure the right resources are available at the right time to meet project objectives.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this Resource Management Framework are to:

1. Ensure sufficient resources are available to meet project requirements
2. Optimize resource utilization across project activities
3. Balance resource workload to prevent burnout and maintain quality
4. Identify and address skill gaps through training and acquisition
5. Provide visibility into resource availability and allocation
6. Support effective decision-making regarding resource trade-offs
7. Enable accurate estimation and planning of resource needs

   - Define resource requirements by role and time period

2. **Supply Analysis**
   - Inventory available resources
   - Assess current allocation and availability
   - Identify resource constraints
   - Evaluate resource capabilities and skills

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare demand against supply
   - Identify shortfalls in capacity or capabilities
   - Determine timing of resource gaps
   - Quantify gap impact on project schedule

4. **Capacity Plan Development**
   - Develop strategies to address resource gaps
