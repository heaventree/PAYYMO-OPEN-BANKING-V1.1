# Payymo Project Planning

## Project Vision

Payymo is a comprehensive financial management platform that combines advanced automation, intelligent payment processing, and user-centric design for seamless financial tracking and optimization. It serves as a bridge between banking systems and WHMCS, providing automatic reconciliation of payments.

## Core Objectives

1. **Streamline Financial Management**: Automate the connection between bank transactions and WHMCS invoices
2. **Enhance Data Visibility**: Provide clear dashboards and reports for financial metrics
3. **Reduce Manual Work**: Eliminate the need for manual matching of payments to invoices
4. **Improve Accuracy**: Use intelligent algorithms to correctly match transactions
5. **Maintain Security**: Ensure secure handling of financial data and connections

## Technical Architecture

### Core Layers

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - NobleUI Dashboard (Bootstrap 5-based UI framework)
   - Chart.js for data visualization
   - Responsive design supporting desktop and tablet views

2. **Application Layer**
   - Flask backend with Jinja2 templating
   - SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions
   - RESTful API design for service interactions

3. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL database for structured data
   - Transaction and matching algorithms
   - Data validation and integrity checks

4. **Integration Layer**
   - GoCardless API for Open Banking connections
   - Stripe API for payment processing
   - WHMCS API for invoice data

### Architectural Principles

1. **Multi-Tenant Design**
   - Each WHMCS installation is a separate tenant
   - Tenant data is segregated for security and scalability
   - License keys control access and feature availability

2. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
   - Modular services for banking, payments, and reconciliation
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Reusable components for consistent implementation

3. **Security First**
   - OAuth2 for secure API access
   - Encrypted storage of sensitive data
   - Regular security audits and updates

## Technical Constraints

1. **Performance Requirements**
   - Dashboard load time < 2 seconds
   - Transaction matching processing < 5 seconds per batch
   - API response time < 500ms for standard operations

2. **Compatibility Requirements**
   - Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Compatible with WHMCS v7.0 and higher
   - Support for standard banking APIs

3. **Infrastructure Constraints**
   - Deployable on standard web hosting
   - Minimal resource requirements (CPU/Memory)
   - Support for shared hosting environments

## Implementation Scope
