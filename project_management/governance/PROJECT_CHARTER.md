# Payymo Project Charter

## Project Overview

### Project Vision
Payymo will revolutionize financial management for WHMCS users by providing a seamless, secure, and intelligent platform that automates payment reconciliation between banking systems and Stripe, drastically reducing manual work while increasing accuracy and financial visibility.

### Project Mission
To develop an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant SaaS solution that connects with GoCardless (Open Banking) and Stripe to automate transaction matching, reconciliation, and payment processing for WHMCS-based businesses, ensuring compliance with financial regulations while providing exceptional user experience.

### Business Case

2. Lowering payment reconciliation errors by 95%
3. Providing real-time financial visibility across payment platforms
4. Increasing automation of payment application to invoices
5. Improving audit trails and compliance reporting

The market opportunity is substantial, with over 50,000 WHMCS installations globally and a growing demand for financial automation solutions in the SMB hosting sector.
