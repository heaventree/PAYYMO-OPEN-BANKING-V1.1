# Payymo Security Model

## Version: 1.0 (April 15, 2025)

## 1. Security Overview

### 1.1 Security Philosophy
The Payymo security model follows a defense-in-depth approach, implementing multiple layers of security controls to protect sensitive financial data and maintain the integrity of the system. The model prioritizes secure authentication, proper authorization, data protection, and robust error handling while maintaining a positive user experience.

### 1.2 Threat Model
The system is designed to protect against the following primary threats:
- Unauthorized access to financial data
- Credential theft and account takeover
- API abuse and data manipulation
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.)
- Payment fraud and manipulation

## 2. Authentication Security

### 2.1 JWT Implementation
The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with the following security enhancements:

#### 2.1.1 Asymmetric Cryptography
- **Algorithm**: RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
- **Key Structure**: Public/private key pair
- **Key Storage**: Private keys stored securely, accessible only by the authentication service
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation policy with graceful transition

#### 2.1.2 Token Structure
- **Access Tokens**:
  - Short-lived (15 minutes)
  - Includes standard claims (iss, sub, aud, exp, nbf, iat, jti)
  - Contains user permissions and tenant information
  - Used for API access authorization

- **Refresh Tokens**:
  - Longer-lived (7 days)
  - Separate audience to prevent misuse
  - Used only for obtaining new access tokens
  - Tracked in database for revocation capability

#### 2.1.3 Token Security Controls
- **Revocation Tracking**: All tokens can be invalidated through the TokenRevocation database
- **Expiration Enforcement**: Strict validation of token expiration
- **Audience Validation**: Ensures tokens are used only for their intended purpose
- **Issuer Checking**: Validates the token issuer to prevent token forgery
- **JTI Tracking**: Unique token identifier for tracking and revocation

### 2.2 Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**: 
   - Validates email format and existence (optional external API)
   - Enforces password complexity requirements
   - Securely hashes passwords with bcrypt and appropriate work factor
   - Prevents email enumeration attacks

2. **Login**:
   - Implements anti-timing attack measures (constant-time comparison)
   - Uses rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Issues both access and refresh tokens
   - Logs authentication events for security monitoring

3. **Token Validation**:
   - Verifies token signature with public key
   - Checks expiration, audience, and issuer
   - Validates against revocation database
   - Extracts and validates permissions

4. **Token Refresh**:
   - Requires valid refresh token
   - Issues new access token
   - Optional refresh token rotation on use
   - Validates user session is still active

5. **Logout**:
   - Revokes tokens by adding to revocation database
   - Clears client-side storage (instruction to frontend)
   - Provides feedback on successful logout

### 2.3 Anti-Timing Attack Protection
The system implements multiple measures to prevent timing attacks:

#### 2.3.1 Password Verification
- Uses constant-time comparison for password hashes
- Implements dummy password check for non-existent users
- Ensures consistent response times regardless of whether user exists

#### 2.3.2 Token Validation
- Uses constant-time comparison for token signatures
- Maintains consistent processing time for all token validation steps
- Standardized error responses regardless of failure reason

### 2.4 Rate Limiting
The system uses tiered rate limiting to prevent abuse:

#### 2.4.1 Authentication Endpoints
- **Login**: 5 attempts per minute, 20 per hour, 100 per day
- **Registration**: 3 attempts per minute, 10 per hour, 20 per day
- **Token Refresh**: 10 attempts per minute, 30 per hour, 200 per day

#### 2.4.2 API Endpoints
- **Standard API**: 10 requests per minute, 50 per hour, 200 per day
- **Batch Operations**: 5 requests per minute, 20 per hour, 100 per day

#### 2.4.3 Rate Limit Implementation
- Uses client IP address and user ID (when available) for tracking
- Implements proper headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, Retry-After)
- Graceful degradation during rate limit events

## 3. Authorization Security

### 3.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The system implements a comprehensive RBAC model:

#### 3.1.1 Role Hierarchy
- **Super Admin**: System-wide access
- **Tenant Admin**: Full access to tenant resources
- **Account Manager**: Manage bank connections and transactions
- **Analyst**: View and analyze data
- **Read-Only**: View-only access to reports and dashboard

#### 3.1.2 Permission Structure
Permissions follow a resource-action format:
- `resource:action` (e.g., `transactions:read`, `banks:connect`)
- Composite permissions using wildcards (e.g., `transactions:*`)
- Negative permissions for granular access control

#### 3.1.3 Permission Enforcement
- Middleware-based enforcement for API routes
- Service-level validation for business logic
- Database-level constraints for data access

### 3.2 Multi-Tenant Isolation
The system implements strict tenant isolation:

#### 3.2.1 Tenant Identification
- JWT claims include tenant_id
- All requests are scoped to specific tenant
- Cross-tenant access restricted to super admin

#### 3.2.2 Data Isolation
- Tenant_id foreign keys on all tenant-specific data
- Database queries automatically filtered by tenant
- Validation to prevent tenant ID manipulation

#### 3.2.3 Service Isolation
- Service methods verify tenant context
- Resource ownership validation
- Audit logging for cross-tenant operations

## 4. Data Protection
