# Pre-Launch Security Keys Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the security keys that must be implemented before the MVP launch to ensure proper security measures are in place. The security audit identified hardcoded secrets and default values as critical security vulnerabilities that must be addressed.

## Required Security Keys

| Key Name | Purpose | Implementation Priority | Current Status |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|----------------|
| SESSION_SECRET | Used for secure session management | HIGH | Implemented |
| JWT_SECRET_KEY | Used for secure JWT token signing | HIGH | Required before launch |
| SUPER_ADMIN_KEY | Used for admin authentication | HIGH | Required before launch |
| ENCRYPTION_KEY | Used for sensitive data encryption | HIGH | Required before launch |

## Implementation Timeline

### 1. Key Generation and Storage (1-2 days before launch)
- [ ] Generate strong cryptographic keys for each required secret
- [ ] Document key rotation procedures
- [ ] Set up secure storage for production keys

### 2. Environment Configuration (1 day before launch)
- [ ] Configure production environment with all required keys
- [ ] Validate key presence before application startup
- [ ] Test application with new keys

### 3. Documentation (Same day as key implementation)
- [ ] Document all security keys in the operations manual
- [ ] Create key rotation schedule
- [ ] Document emergency procedures for key compromise

## Key Requirements

### JWT_SECRET_KEY
- Minimum 256-bit strength
- Stored securely in environment variables
- Not exposed in logs or error messages
- Regular rotation schedule (every 30 days)

### SUPER_ADMIN_KEY
- Minimum 256-bit strength
- Complex passphrase if manually entered
- Access restricted to authorized personnel
- Regular rotation schedule (every 30 days)

### ENCRYPTION_KEY
- Minimum 256-bit strength
- Used for encrypting sensitive database fields
- Regular rotation with data re-encryption
- Emergency replacement procedure documented

## Interim Measures

While development continues prior to launch:
1. The application will generate random keys in development environment
2. Warning logs will indicate missing keys
3. Security functionality will operate in degraded mode for testing
4. All production environments will require proper keys

## Responsible Team Members

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Security Lead | Key generation, rotation procedures |
| DevOps | Environment configuration, secure storage |
| Development Lead | Application integration, validation |
| QA Lead | Security testing with production-equivalent keys |

## Success Criteria

- All hardcoded secrets and default values eliminated from codebase
- Application validates presence of all required keys on startup
- Proper error handling for missing or invalid keys
- Security audit verification after implementation
