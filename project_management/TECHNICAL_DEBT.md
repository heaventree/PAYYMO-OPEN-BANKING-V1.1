## Technical Debt Management Plan

### Current Focus
The current focus is on addressing critical security and architectural issues:
1. Complete certificate rotation mechanism (S-01)
2. Implement service interface standardization (A-01)
3. Add comprehensive integration testing (T-01)
4. Create proper CI/CD validation pipelines (DP-01)

### Prioritization Criteria
1. Security issues take precedence
2. Issues blocking other development work
3. Issues affecting system stability
4. Issues affecting developer productivity
5. Issues affecting user experience

### Debt Prevention Strategies
1. Code review checklist with attention to potential debt
2. Regular technical debt review sessions
3. Time allocation for debt reduction in each sprint
4. Technical design documents for new features
5. Automated code quality checks

## Metrics

### Current Metrics
- **Total Open Items**: 30
- **Critical Items (P0)**: 0
- **High Priority Items (P1)**: 12
- **Debt Reduction Rate**: 5 items per month (target)
