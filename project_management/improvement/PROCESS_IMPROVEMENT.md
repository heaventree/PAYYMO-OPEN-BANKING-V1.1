# Payymo Process Improvement Framework

## Introduction

This Process Improvement Framework establishes a systematic approach to continuously evaluate and enhance the software development lifecycle, project management practices, and operational processes within the Payymo project. It defines methodologies for identifying improvement opportunities, implementing changes, measuring outcomes, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. This structured approach ensures that processes evolve to increase efficiency, quality, and value delivery.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this Process Improvement Framework are to:

1. Establish a formal methodology for process assessment and improvement
2. Create mechanisms for capturing improvement opportunities
3. Provide tools and techniques for analyzing process performance
4. Define clear implementation approaches for process changes
5. Establish metrics for measuring improvement effectiveness
6. Foster a culture of continuous improvement within the team
7. Ensure knowledge sharing and learning from improvement initiatives

## Improvement Methodology
