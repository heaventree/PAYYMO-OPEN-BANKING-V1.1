### 2. Risk Assessment

#### Risk Analysis Matrix

Risks are assessed based on two primary dimensions:

1. **Probability**: Likelihood of the risk occurring
2. **Impact**: Consequence severity if the risk occurs

**Probability Scale**:

| Level | Rating | Description | Probability Range |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 5 | Very High | Almost certain to occur | 80-100% |
| 4 | High | Likely to occur | 60-79% |
| 3 | Medium | Possible to occur | 40-59% |
| 2 | Low | Unlikely to occur | 20-39% |
| 1 | Very Low | Rare occurrence | 0-19% |

**Impact Scale**:

| Level | Rating | Schedule Impact | Cost Impact | Quality Impact | Security Impact |
|-------|--------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 5 | Critical | > 3 months delay | > 50% cost increase | Severe defects rendering system unusable | Critical data breach or compliance violation |
| 4 | Major | 1-3 months delay | 25-50% cost increase | Major defects impacting core functionality | Significant security vulnerability with direct exposure |
| 3 | Moderate | 2-4 weeks delay | 10-24% cost increase | Noticeable defects impacting important functionality | Moderate security vulnerability requiring significant mitigation |
| 2 | Minor | 1-2 weeks delay | 5-9% cost increase | Minor defects with workarounds available | Minor security concern with straightforward mitigation |
| 1 | Negligible | < 1 week delay | < 5% cost increase | Cosmetic defects only | Minimal security concerns with easy mitigation |

**Risk Score Calculation**:
* Risk Score = Probability × Impact
* Range: 1 (minimum) to 25 (maximum)

**Risk Priority Levels**:

| Risk Score | Priority Level | Description | Review Frequency | Approval Level |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 20-25 | Critical | Requires immediate action | Weekly | Executive Sponsor |
| 15-19 | High | Significant risk requiring mitigation | Bi-weekly | Steering Committee |
| 9-14 | Medium | Moderate risk requiring monitoring | Monthly | Project Manager |
| 4-8 | Low | Minor risk with limited consequences | Quarterly | Technical Lead |
| 1-3 | Very Low | Minimal impact, typically accepted | Bi-annually | Team Lead |

#### Assessment Process

1. **Initial Assessment**: Conducted when a risk is first identified
2. **Group Validation**: Review in risk workshop to ensure consistent evaluation
3. **Expert Review**: Subject matter expert review for technical/specialized risks
4. **Periodic Reassessment**: Regular review based on priority level frequency

### 3. Risk Response Planning

For each identified and assessed risk, a specific response strategy is developed:

#### Response Strategies

1. **Avoid**: Eliminate the threat by removing the cause
   * Example: Change requirements to eliminate a risky feature
   * Example: Use proven technology instead of experimental approach

2. **Transfer**: Shift the risk impact to a third party
   * Example: Purchase insurance
   * Example: Outsource complex components to specialized vendors

3. **Mitigate**: Reduce probability and/or impact
   * Example: Implement additional testing
   * Example: Add redundant systems
   * Example: Develop prototypes or proofs of concept

4. **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk without taking action
   * **Active Acceptance**: Develop contingency plans but take no immediate action
   * **Passive Acceptance**: Accept consequences if risk occurs

#### Response Plan Requirements

Each risk response plan must include:

1. **Strategy**: Selected response strategy (avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept)
2. **Actions**: Specific actions to implement the strategy
3. **Resources**: Personnel, budget, and tools required
4. **Timeline**: Schedule for implementing response actions
5. **Success Criteria**: How effectiveness will be measured
6. **Responsible Party**: Named individual accountable for implementation
7. **Contingency Plan**: Secondary plan if primary response fails

### 4. Risk Monitoring and Control

#### Monitoring Process

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule based on risk priority level
