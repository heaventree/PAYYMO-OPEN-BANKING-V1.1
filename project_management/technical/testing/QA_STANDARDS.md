# Testing and QA Standards for Payymo

This document outlines the testing and quality assurance standards for the Payymo financial platform. Following these standards is critical to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of our financial services application.

## Core Testing Philosophy

For Payymo, a financial application dealing with sensitive banking and payment data, our testing philosophy prioritizes:

1. **Security**: All testing must validate that sensitive financial data is properly protected
2. **Accuracy**: Financial transactions and calculations must be verified with high precision
3. **Reliability**: Systems must be thoroughly tested for all edge cases and failure scenarios
4. **Performance**: The application must maintain responsiveness even under heavy transaction loads
5. **Compliance**: Tests must verify regulatory compliance requirements are met

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach:

```
    /\
   /  \      E2E Tests
  /    \     (Critical user flows)
 /      \
/--------\   Integration Tests
|        |   (API, component interaction)
|--------|
|        |
|        |   Unit Tests
|        |   (Business logic, utilities)
|________|
```

## Unit Testing

### Framework & Tools
- **Backend**: pytest for Python Flask services
- **Frontend**: Jest with React Testing Library for UI components

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical business logic
- Minimum 70% code coverage for overall codebase
- Focus on quality of tests over pure coverage percentages

### Unit Test Focus Areas
- Financial calculation functions (must be tested with decimal precision)
- Transaction processing logic
- Data mapping and transformation functions
- Authentication and authorization helpers
- Form validation logic
- Error handling routines

### Example Backend Unit Test

```python
import pytest
from services.transaction_service import TransactionService
from models import Transaction

def test_transaction_matching_calculation():
    # Arrange
    service = TransactionService()
    transaction = Transaction(
        transaction_id="tr_123",
        amount=100.50,
        description="Invoice #12345",
        reference="INV-12345"
    )
    invoice_number = "12345"
    
    # Act
    confidence = service.calculate_match_confidence(transaction, invoice_number)
    
    # Assert
    assert confidence > 0.9, "High confidence match should be detected"
    
def test_transaction_matching_no_match():
    # Arrange
    service = TransactionService()
    transaction = Transaction(
        transaction_id="tr_123",
        amount=100.50,
        description="Payment for services",
        reference=""
    )
    invoice_number = "12345"
    
    # Act
    confidence = service.calculate_match_confidence(transaction, invoice_number)
    
    # Assert
    assert confidence < 0.3, "No match should result in low confidence"
```

## Integration Testing

### Framework & Tools
- **Backend**: pytest with test client for API integration tests
- **Database**: Dedicated test database with sample data
- **External APIs**: Mock servers for GoCardless and Stripe API simulation

### Integration Test Focus Areas
- API endpoint validation (request/response integrity)
- Database interactions (queries, transactions, rollbacks)
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Service-to-service communication
- Authentication flows
- Webhook processing

### Example Integration Test

```python
def test_bank_connection_integration(test_client, mock_gocardless):
    # Setup mock response for GoCardless
    mock_gocardless.add_response(
        method="POST",
        path="/connect/token",
        json={"access_token": "test_token", "expires_in": 3600}
    )
    
    # Test bank connection creation
    response = test_client.post(
        "/api/v1/bank_connections",
        json={
            "bank_id": "test_bank",
            "authorization_code": "test_auth_code",
            "account_name": "Test Account"
        },
        headers={"Authorization": "Bearer test_user_token"}
    )
    
    # Assertions
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert response.json.get("status") == "active"
    assert "bank_connection_id" in response.json
    
    # Verify database state
    with db_session() as session:
        connection = session.query(BankConnection).filter_by(
            bank_id="test_bank"
        ).first()
        assert connection is not None
        assert connection.access_token == "test_token"
```

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

### Framework & Tools
- Cypress for web application E2E testing
- Dedicated staging environment with test data

### E2E Test Focus Areas
- Complete user journeys (bank connection setup, transaction viewing, reconciliation)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Navigation and user flow
- Error state handling and recovery

### Critical E2E Test Scenarios

1. **Bank Connection Flow**
   - User connects a new bank account
   - Authorization is properly handled
   - Transactions appear after successful connection

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Transaction list loads correctly with pagination
   - Filtering and sorting work properly
   - Transaction details show correct information

3. **Reconciliation Process**
   - Automatic matches are correctly identified
   - Manual matching can be performed
   - Match approval process works as expected

### Example E2E Test

```javascript
describe('Bank Connection Flow', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.login('test@example.com', 'password'); // Custom login command
    cy.visit('/dashboard');
  });

  it('allows connecting a new bank account', () => {
    // Start bank connection process
    cy.get('[data-testid="add-bank-connection"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/connect-bank');
    
    // Select bank from list
    cy.get('[data-testid="bank-option-test_bank"]').click();
    
    // Mock bank authorization
    cy.intercept('POST', '/api/v1/bank_connections/authorize', {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: { redirect_url: '/mock-bank-auth' }
    }).as('authorizeRequest');
    
    cy.get('[data-testid="continue-button"]').click();
    cy.wait('@authorizeRequest');
    
    // Mock successful bank authentication
    cy.intercept('POST', '/api/v1/bank_connections/callback', {
      statusCode: 201,
      body: { 
        id: 'bank_conn_123',
        status: 'active',
        bank_name: 'Test Bank',
        account_name: 'Current Account'
      }
    }).as('callbackRequest');
    
    // Simulate return from bank auth
    cy.visit('/connect-bank/callback?code=test_auth_code&state=test_state');
    cy.wait('@callbackRequest');
    
    // Verify success and redirect to dashboard
    cy.get('[data-testid="success-message"]')
      .should('contain.text', 'Bank connected successfully');
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
    
    // Verify bank appears in the list
    cy.get('[data-testid="bank-connection-list"]')
      .should('contain.text', 'Test Bank');
  });
});
```
