# Security Guidelines for Payymo

This document outlines the security standards for the Payymo financial platform, which handles sensitive financial data and integrates with external banking services.

## Core Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement security at every layer of the application
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal permissions needed for each operation
3. **Secure by Default**: Ensure all features start with the most secure configuration
4. **Assume Breach**: Design systems to limit damage if a breach occurs
5. **Auditability**: Ensure all security-relevant actions are logged and traceable

## Authentication & User Management

### Authentication Strategy

- **Primary Method**: OAuth 2.0 flows for bank connections and Stripe integrations
- **Password Security**: 
  - Store only properly salted password hashes using Argon2id or bcrypt
  - Enforce strong password requirements (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
  - Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts
  - Regularly audit user access and enforce password rotation for admin accounts

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **Admin Accounts**: Require MFA for all administrator accounts
- **User Accounts**: Strongly encourage MFA, especially for accounts managing financial connections
- **Recovery**: Provide secure recovery methods if MFA devices are lost

### Session Management

- **Tokens**: 
  - Use short-lived access tokens (15-60 minutes)
  - Implement token rotation for refresh tokens
  - Store tokens securely using HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite cookies
- **Session Timeout**: Automatically expire inactive sessions after 30 minutes
- **Device Management**: Allow users to view and terminate active sessions

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Role Definitions

1. **System Administrator**: Full system access, including user management and system configuration
2. **Financial Administrator**: Access to financial reporting and reconciliation features
3. **Account Manager**: Ability to manage bank connections and view transaction data
4. **Read-Only User**: Can only view data without making changes
5. **API Integration**: Limited access for automated systems

### Permission Implementation

- Enforce permissions at the API level, not just the UI
- Validate all permission checks server-side
- Log permission failures for security monitoring
- Implement tenant isolation for multi-tenant aspects of the system

## API Security

### Input Validation

- Validate all user inputs server-side, even if validated client-side
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Apply appropriate data sanitization for all user-provided content
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints

### API Authentication

- Use OAuth 2.0 for all external service integrations
- Require API keys for service-to-service communication
- Implement proper token validation with signature verification
- Enforce HTTPS for all API communication

### Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Login endpoints: 5 requests per minute to prevent brute force attacks
- Transaction endpoints: 30 requests per minute for regular operational use
- OAuth endpoints: 10 requests per minute to prevent OAuth abuse
- Match/apply endpoints: 15 requests per minute to prevent abuse
- Adjust limits based on endpoint sensitivity and expected usage patterns
- Log and alert on repeated rate limit violations

### Secure Defaults

- All resources are private by default
- Use UUID instead of sequential IDs for all user-facing resources
- Prevent mass assignment vulnerabilities by explicitly whitelisting fields

## Financial Data Security

### Data Protection

- Encrypt all financial data at rest
- Implement proper field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Minimize storage of sensitive financial details
- Implement proper data retention and deletion policies

### Transaction Security

- Validate and log all financial transactions
- Implement reconciliation processes to detect discrepancies
- Establish secure processes for handling failed transactions
- Create audit trails for all financial operations

### Bank Connection Security

- Use OAuth for bank authentication instead of storing credentials
- Store access tokens securely with proper encryption
- Implement token refresh mechanisms following OAuth best practices
- Monitor connection status and alert on failures

## HTTP Security Headers

Implement the following headers on all responses:

- **Strict-Transport-Security**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restrict to trusted sources only
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff`
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY` (or `SAMEORIGIN` if necessary)
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restrict unnecessary browser features

## CSRF Protection

- Use SameSite=Strict cookies for authentication
- Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
- Validate the origin/referer header as an additional check

## Dependency Security

- Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use tools like GitHub Dependabot to automate dependency updates
- Maintain an inventory of all third-party components
- Have a process for quickly applying security patches

## Secrets Management

- Never hardcode secrets in the codebase
- Use environment variables for configuration in development
- Consider a dedicated secrets management service for production
- Implement proper key rotation procedures

## Security Monitoring & Logging

### Event Logging

Log the following security events at a minimum:

- Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- Permission changes or escalations
- Bank connection status changes
- Significant financial transactions
- Admin actions and configuration changes

### Log Requirements

- Include timestamps, user IDs, request IDs, and relevant context
- Forward logs to a centralized, secured logging system
- Implement log rotation and retention policies
- Ensure logs are protected from unauthorized access

### Monitoring & Alerting

- Set up real-time alerts for suspicious activity
- Monitor for brute force attempts and unusual access patterns
- Implement automatic blocking of suspicious IP addresses
- Create dashboards for security monitoring

## Incident Response

1. **Preparation**: Document procedures for security incidents
2. **Detection**: Implement monitoring to quickly identify potential breaches
3. **Containment**: Have procedures to isolate compromised components
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat from the environment
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update procedures based on incidents

## Security Review Process

- Conduct regular security code reviews
- Consider periodic penetration testing
- Use automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline
- Maintain a vulnerability management process

## Implementation Examples

### Flask Security Middleware

```python
@app.before_request
def security_middleware():
    # Enforce HTTPS
    if not request.is_secure and app.config['ENFORCE_HTTPS']:
        return redirect(request.url.replace('http://', 'https://'), code=301)
    
    # Check CSRF token for state-changing requests
    if request.method in ['POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH']:
        token = request.headers.get('X-CSRF-Token')
        if not token or not verify_csrf_token(token):
            abort(403, description="Invalid CSRF token")
    
    # Add security headers
    @app.after_request
    def add_security_headers(response):
        response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
        response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
        response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
        response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
        return response
```

### Permission Check Example

```python
def check_permission(user, action, resource):
    """
    Check if a user has permission to perform an action on a resource
    
    Args:
        user: The user object
        action: The action being performed (e.g., 'read', 'write', 'delete')
        resource: The resource being accessed
        
    Returns:
        bool: True if permitted, False otherwise
    """
    # Check if user has direct permission
    if user.has_permission(f"{action}:{resource.type}"):
        return True
    
    # Check if user owns the resource
    if hasattr(resource, 'owner_id') and resource.owner_id == user.id:
        return True
    
    # Check tenant isolation for multi-tenant resources
    if hasattr(resource, 'tenant_id') and resource.tenant_id != user.tenant_id:
        return False
    
    # Check role-based permissions
    for role in user.roles:
        if role.has_permission(f"{action}:{resource.type}"):
            return True
    
    return False
```
