# Integration Plan for April 10 Technical Standards

This document outlines the plan for integrating all April 10 technical standards into our project documentation structure.

## Overview

The April 10 standards provide comprehensive guidelines across multiple aspects of the project. We will systematically incorporate these standards into our project management documentation structure by:

1. Creating dedicated documents for each major technical area
2. Updating the master index with references to all new documents
3. Ensuring backward compatibility with existing documentation

## Standards to Integrate

## Integration Process

For each standard document, we will:

1. Create a new markdown file in the appropriate project directory
2. Extract and adapt the relevant content from the April 10 standards
3. Format the content according to our documentation conventions
4. Add references to the master index

## Directory Structure

The integrated documentation will be organized into these directories:

```

```

## Priority Order

We will implement these standards in the following priority order:

1. Architecture and Security (foundational aspects)
2. Backend and API standards (core functionality)
3. Development practices and coding standards
4. Frontend and UI guidelines
5. Operations and DevOps
6. Testing and QA
7. Documentation and project management

## Implementation Timeline

Phase 1 (Immediate):
- Complete all architecture documents
- Complete all security guidelines
- Complete API integration guidelines

Phase 2 (Next 48 hours):
- Implement backend development patterns
- Implement coding standards
- Implement error handling guidelines

Phase 3 (By end of week):
- Complete remaining frontend documents
- Complete operations documents
- Complete testing guidelines

Phase 4 (Final phase):
- Integrate all project management documents
- Create comprehensive glossary
- Update all references in master index

## Progress Tracking

We will track progress of this integration in the TASK.md file with a new section dedicated to documentation integration. Each completed document will be marked with a completion date and any notes about modifications from the original.
