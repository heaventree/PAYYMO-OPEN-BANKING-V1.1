# Payymo Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Introduction

This Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) establishes a structured framework for tracking the lifecycle of all project requirements, from initial specification through implementation to verification. It provides a crucial mechanism for ensuring that all requirements are properly implemented and tested, maintaining alignment between business needs and delivered functionality throughout the project lifecycle.

## Purpose and Objectives

The primary objectives of this Requirements Traceability Matrix are to:

1. Establish clear traceability between business requirements and implementation
2. Ensure all requirements are properly implemented and verified
3. Facilitate impact analysis when requirements change
4. Support comprehensive test coverage aligned with requirements
5. Provide an audit trail for compliance and governance
6. Enable efficient project status tracking and reporting

## Traceability Structure

### Requirement Hierarchy

The Payymo project uses a hierarchical approach to requirements:

1. **Business Requirements (BR)**: High-level business needs
2. **User Requirements (UR)**: User-focused requirements
3. **Functional Requirements (FR)**: Specific system functions
4. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**: Quality attributes
5. **Technical Requirements (TR)**: Implementation-specific details

### Traceability Relationships

The RTM tracks the following relationships:

1. **Forward Traceability**: From business requirements to implementation
   - Business Requirements → User Requirements
   - User Requirements → Functional/Non-Functional Requirements
   - Functional/Non-Functional Requirements → Technical Requirements
   - Technical Requirements → Implementation Artifacts

2. **Backward Traceability**: From implementation to business requirements
   - Implementation Artifacts → Technical Requirements
   - Technical Requirements → Functional/Non-Functional Requirements
   - Functional/Non-Functional Requirements → User Requirements
   - User Requirements → Business Requirements

3. **Verification Traceability**: To test cases and validation methods
   - Requirements → Test Cases/Acceptance Criteria
   - Test Cases → Test Results

## Requirement Attributes

Each requirement includes the following attributes:

1. **ID**: Unique identifier with prefix indicating type (BR-, UR-, FR-, NFR-, TR-)
2. **Title**: Brief descriptive title
3. **Description**: Detailed explanation of the requirement
4. **Priority**: Importance level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
5. **Source**: Origin of the requirement (stakeholder, document, etc.)
6. **Status**: Current state (Proposed, Approved, Implemented, Verified, Deferred)
7. **Owner**: Person responsible for the requirement
8. **Related Requirements**: IDs of related requirements
9. **Verification Method**: How requirement will be verified (Test, Demo, Inspection, Analysis)
10. **Version**: Current version number
11. **Change History**: Record of changes to the requirement
