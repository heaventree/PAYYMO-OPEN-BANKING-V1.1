- [x] Implemented database backup functionality
- [x] Created verification processes for database integrity
- [x] Added CLI commands for database operations
- [x] Fixed proper database access patterns

### Logging and Error Handling
- [x] Implemented centralized logging system
- [x] Added request tracking with timing information
- [x] Created context-aware error logging

- [ ] Implement proper error handling for banking operations

## Upcoming Tasks

### Testing Framework
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Create integration tests for banking services
- [ ] Set up continuous integration testing for migrations

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Update technical documentation for services

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Add performance metrics and monitoring

## Technical Debt
1. Inconsistent method signatures in service classes
2. Default encryption keys in development environment
3. Mixing of direct database creation and migrations
4. Incomplete certificate handling for webhooks

## Dependencies
- GoCardless API access
- Stripe integration
- PostgreSQL database
- WHMCS compatibility

## Notes
- The application is currently running successfully in development mode
- Multiple warnings about missing secrets need addressing before production
- Database migration utilities are functioning correctly
- Frontend components (bank wizard, Stripe integration) are working as expected
