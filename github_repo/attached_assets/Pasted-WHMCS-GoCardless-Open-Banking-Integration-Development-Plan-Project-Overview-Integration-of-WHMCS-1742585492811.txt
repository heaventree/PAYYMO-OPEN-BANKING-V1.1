WHMCS & GoCardless Open Banking Integration Development Plan

Project Overview

Integration of WHMCS billing system with GoCardless Open Banking API, enabling automated bank transaction checks, robust invoice matching, manual payment handling, clean UI/UX, comprehensive error handling, and effective licensing for a retail product.

Objectives

Automate bank transaction retrieval via cron jobs.

Enable both automatic and admin-approved manual payment linking to invoices.

Support partial and full invoice payments.

Provide intuitive dashboard widgets within WHMCS admin.

Implement secure, robust licensing with API validation.

Integrate CI/CD for seamless updates via Git.
