\# Use official Node\.js LTS image as a parent image  
FROM node:18\-alpine AS base  
  
\# Set working directory  
WORKDIR /app  
  
\# Install dependencies only when needed  
FROM base AS deps  
\# Check https://github\.com/nodejs/docker\-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3\#nodealpine to understand why libc6\-compat might be needed\.  
RUN apk add \-\-no\-cache libc6\-compat  
COPY package\.json pnpm\-lock\.yaml\* \./  
RUN \\  
  if \[ \-f pnpm\-lock\.yaml \]; then \\  
  pnpm install \-\-frozen\-lockfile; \\  
  elif \[ \-f package\-lock\.json \]; then \\  
  npm ci; \\  
  else \\  
  npm i; \\  
  fi  
  
\# Rebuild the source code only when needed  
FROM base AS builder  
WORKDIR /app  
COPY \-\-from=deps /app/node\_modules \./node\_modules  
COPY \. \.  
  
\# Next\.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage\.  
\# Learn more here: https://nextjs\.org/telemetry  
\# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during the build\.  
\# ENV NEXT\_TELEMETRY\_DISABLED 1  
  
RUN pnpm build \# Or npm run build  
  
\# Production image, copy all the files and run next  
FROM base AS runner  
WORKDIR /app  
  
ENV NODE\_ENV production  
\# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during runtime\.  
\# ENV NEXT\_TELEMETRY\_DISABLED 1  
  
\# Copy necessary files from builder stage  
COPY \-\-from=builder /app/public \./public  
\# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size  
\# https://nextjs\.org/docs/advanced\-features/output\-file\-tracing  
COPY \-\-from=builder \-\-chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/\.next/standalone \./  
COPY \-\-from=builder \-\-chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/\.next/static \./\.next/static  
  
\# Set the correct permission for prerender cache  
RUN mkdir \.next/cache && chown node:node \.next/cache  
  
\# Expose the port the app runs on  
EXPOSE 3000  
  
\# Set hostname for production  
ENV HOSTNAME "0\.0\.0\.0"  
  
\# Server\.js is created by next build from the standalone output  
\# https://nextjs\.org/docs/pages/api\-reference/next\-config\-js/output  
CMD \["node", "server\.js"\]  
  


## __CI/CD__

- __Platform:__ GitHub Actions
- __Workflow Triggers:__ On push to main, staging branches, and on pull requests targeting these branches\.
- __Pipeline Stages:__
	1. __Checkout:__ Check out the repository code\.
	2. __Setup:__ Set up Node\.js environment, install dependencies \(pnpm install\)\.
	3. __Lint & Format:__ Run ESLint and Prettier checks \(pnpm lint\)\. Fail if errors occur\.
	4. __Test:__ Run unit and integration tests \(pnpm test \-\-coverage\)\. Fail if tests fail or coverage drops below threshold\.
	5. __Build:__ Build the application \(pnpm build\)\. Fail on build errors\.
	6. __\(Optional\) E2E Tests:__ Run Cypress/Playwright tests against a preview deployment or staging environment\.
	7. __Deploy:__ Deploy the built application to the appropriate target \(Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Fly\.io for backend\) based on the branch\.

## __Monitoring__

- __Error Tracking:__ Sentry for frontend and backend crash logs and error reporting\.
- __Performance/Uptime:__ UptimeRobot \(basic uptime checks\), Datadog/New Relic \(application performance monitoring \- APM\), Vercel/Netlify/Render built\-in analytics\.
- __Logging:__ Centralized logging service \(e\.g\., Logtail, Papertrail, Datadog Logs\) aggregating logs from all services\. \(See 09\_Error\_Handling\_Debugging\.md\)\.

## __Environment Setup__

- \.env\.example defines required environment variables\.
- \.env\.local \(Git\-ignored\) for local development overrides\.
- Staging and Production environments use environment variables injected by the hosting provider or secrets management system \(e\.g\., Doppler, AWS Secrets Manager, GitHub Secrets\)\.

## __Failover & Scaling__

- __Load Balancing:__ Use load balancers provided by hosting platforms \(Render, Fly\.io\) or Cloudflare\.
- __Auto\-scaling:__ Configure auto\-scaling rules on hosting platforms based on CPU/memory usage or request count\.
- __Database:__ Utilize read replicas for scaling read traffic if necessary\. Ensure managed database services have automated failover configured\. \(See 11\_Backup\_Recovery\_Safety\.md\)\.
- __CDN:__ Use Cloudflare or hosting provider's CDN for caching static assets and reducing origin load\.
