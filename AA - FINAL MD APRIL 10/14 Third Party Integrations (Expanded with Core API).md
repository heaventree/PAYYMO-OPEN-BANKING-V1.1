# __Third\-Party Integrations \(Expanded with Core API\)__

This document details integrations *with* external services and, critically, outlines the requirements for the application's *own* core API provided *to* external systems and customers\.

## __1\. Core Application API for External Integrations \(CRITICAL\)__

- __Purpose:__ To enable seamless connection and data exchange with external systems\. This is essential for:
	- __Enterprise Customers:__ Allowing them to integrate the SaaS application into their existing workflows, build custom reports, or develop bespoke extensions\.
	- __White\-Label Partners:__ Providing programmatic access for partners to manage their instances or integrate with their own portals\.
	- __Integration Platforms:__ Enabling connections via platforms like Zapier, Make\.com, Integrately, Tray\.io, etc\.
	- __CRM/ERP Sync:__ Facilitating data synchronization with systems like HubSpot, Salesforce, NetSuite, etc\.
	- __Internal Tooling:__ Allowing other internal company systems to interact with the application\.
- __Design Principles:__
	- __RESTful:__ Adhere to REST principles \(resource\-oriented URLs, proper HTTP verb usage, standard status codes\)\. See Backend\_Development\_Patterns\.md\.
	- __Well\-Documented:__ Provide comprehensive, accurate, and easy\-to\-understand API documentation using the __OpenAPI \(Swagger\) specification__\. Documentation should be publicly accessible \(or accessible to authenticated users/partners\) and ideally include interactive examples \(e\.g\., via Swagger UI\)\.
	- __Stable & Reliable:__ Ensure API endpoints are stable and backward\-compatible within a version\. Minimize breaking changes\.
	- __Secure:__ All API endpoints must enforce proper authentication and authorization \(see below and 13\_Authentication\_Security\.md\)\.
	- __Performant:__ Design endpoints for efficiency; implement caching where appropriate\. Monitor API performance\.
	- __Consistent:__ Maintain consistent naming conventions, request/response structures, and error handling across all endpoints\.
- __Authentication:__
	- __API Keys:__ Primary method for server\-to\-server integrations\.
		- Keys should be user\-generated \(or admin\-generated for specific users/partners\)\.
		- Keys must be securely stored \(hashed in DB, original shown only once upon generation\)\.
		- Implement mechanisms for users/admins to revoke keys\.
		- Keys must be scoped to a specific tenant/organization in multi\-tenant environments\.
		- Keys should be passed securely via HTTP headers \(e\.g\., Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_API\_KEY or X\-API\-Key: YOUR\_API\_KEY\)\.
	- __OAuth 2\.0 \(Optional\):__ Consider implementing OAuth 2\.0 \(Client Credentials flow for machine\-to\-machine, or Authorization Code flow for delegated user permissions\) for more complex scenarios or integrations requiring user\-level permissions\.
- __Versioning:__ Implement API versioning from the start \(e\.g\., /api/v1/resource, /api/v2/resource\)\. Clearly document changes between versions and provide a deprecation policy for older versions\. See 24\_Future\_Proofing\_Scalability\.md\.
- __Rate Limiting & Throttling:__ Implement strict rate limiting per API key/user/tenant to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage\. Communicate limits clearly in the documentation\. Use HTTP status code 429 Too Many Requests when limits are exceeded\.
- __Tenant Scoping:__ All API responses and actions __must__ be strictly scoped to the tenant associated with the authenticated API key or user\. There should be no possibility of data leakage between tenants via the API\.
- __SDKs \(Optional but Recommended\):__ Consider providing official Software Development Kits \(SDKs\) in popular languages \(e\.g\., JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, PHP, Ruby\) to simplify integration for developers\.
- __Webhooks \(Outbound\):__ Complement the API by providing outbound webhooks that external systems can subscribe to\. This allows the application to proactively notify external systems about specific events \(e\.g\., form\.created, user\.updated, payment\.succeeded\)\. See Section 4 below\.

## __2\. Stripe \(Connect\)__

- __Purpose:__ Subscription billing, marketplace payments, client invoicing\.
- __Integration:__ Use libraries, Elements, and validated webhooks as previously detailed\. Focus on robust handling of Stripe Connect workflows if applicable\.
- __Security:__ As previously detailed \(secure keys, webhook validation, idempotency\)\.

## __3\. Email \(IMAP/SMTP\)__

- __Purpose:__ Bi\-directional email integration, transactional notifications\.
- __Integration:__ Use libraries and transactional email services as previously detailed\. Focus on secure credential handling, reliable delivery \(SPF, DKIM, DMARC\), and asynchronous processing\.
- __Security:__ Scan incoming attachments\. Validate sender domains\.

## __4\. Hosting Automation \(e\.g\., 20i API\)__

- __Purpose:__ Automating hosting setup for white\-label instances\.
- __Integration:__ Use provider APIs with secure key storage, idempotent workflows, and robust error handling as previously detailed\.

## __5\. Workflow Platforms & CRM/ERP Integrations \(Leveraging Core API\)__

- __Purpose:__ Connecting to Zapier, Make\.com, Integrately, HubSpot, Salesforce, etc\.
- __Integration Strategy:__ These platforms will primarily consume the __Core Application API__ \(Section 1\)\.
	- __Authentication:__ Guide users on generating API keys within the application for use in these platforms\. Consider building official "apps" on these platforms that handle OAuth for a smoother user experience\.
	- __Triggers:__ Utilize the application's outbound webhooks \(configured by the user\) to trigger workflows in these platforms\.
	- __Actions:__ These platforms will make calls to the application's Core API to perform actions \(e\.g\., create a contact, fetch data, update a record\)\. Ensure the API provides the necessary endpoints for common actions\.
	- __Documentation:__ Provide specific guides or tutorials for connecting to popular platforms like Zapier, HubSpot, Salesforce, demonstrating how to use the API keys/webhooks\.

## __6\. Analytics & Insights \(PostHog, Google Analytics\)__

- __Purpose:__ Internal application usage tracking\.
- __Integration:__ Use frontend libraries and ensure privacy compliance as previously detailed\. This is typically *not* part of the external API but for internal use\.

## __7\. File Sync \(OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive\)__

- __Purpose:__ Allowing users to connect *their* storage accounts\.
- __Integration:__ Use official SDKs and OAuth 2\.0 as previously detailed\. Focus on secure token storage and requesting minimal necessary permissions\. This involves integrating *with* these services, distinct from the Core API\.
