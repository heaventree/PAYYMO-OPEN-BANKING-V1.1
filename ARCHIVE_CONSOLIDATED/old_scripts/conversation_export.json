Found multiple conflicting route definitions causing problems, implemented a direct override in main.py to force the NobleUI dashboard, the override directly calls the NobleUI dashboard view function, this should bypass any middleware or routing layer issues. Can you please check if the NobleUI dashboard is now showing as the default when you visit the root URL? This more direct approach should work regardless of other routing conflicts.",
