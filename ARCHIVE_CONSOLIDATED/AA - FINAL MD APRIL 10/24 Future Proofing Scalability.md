# __Future\-Proofing & Scalability__

## __Modular Design__

- __Principle:__ Build the application as a collection of loosely coupled, independent modules or features\. Follow principles like Domain\-Driven Design \(DDD\) where applicable\.
- __Implementation:__
	- Use clear directory structures \(src/features/feature\-name\)\. Each feature should ideally manage its own state and interact with others via defined APIs or events\.
	- Define clear interfaces/boundaries between modules \(e\.g\., using TypeScript interfaces for data structures passed between modules\)\. Avoid direct dependencies where possible; use events \(e\.g\., via an event bus or pub/sub mechanism\) or shared state \(managed carefully via Zustand slices\)\.
	- Leverage component\-based architecture \(React\) for UI modularity\.
- __Benefits:__ Easier maintenance, independent team development, ability to replace or upgrade modules with less impact, better testability\.

## __API Versioning__

- __Strategy:__ Implement API versioning for the Core Application API \(see 14\_Third\_Party\_Integrations\.md\) from the start \(e\.g\., /api/v1/resource\)\.
- __Benefits:__ Allows introducing breaking changes in future API versions without disrupting existing clients or integrations\. Essential for external consumers and white\-label partners\.
- __Implementation:__ Use URL path versioning \(e\.g\., /v1/, /v2/\) as it's explicit\. Document API versions clearly using OpenAPI/Swagger\. Have a clear deprecation policy for older versions\.

## __Plugin System / Extensibility__

- __Concept:__ Design core functionalities with well\-defined extension points \(hooks, event listeners, registration APIs\) where custom plugins or modules \(potentially developed by third parties or enterprise customers\) can add functionality without modifying the core codebase\.
- __Examples:__
	- An event bus system where plugins can subscribe to events \(e\.g\., user:created, form:submitted\)\.
	- A registration API where plugins can add new menu items, dashboard widgets, custom form field types, or report types\.
	- Clearly defined interfaces for plugin data structures and interactions\.
- __Benefits:__ Enables customization, third\-party development, easier addition of niche features, and caters to specific enterprise needs\.

## __Migration Strategy \(Data & Schema\)__

- __Tooling:__ Use a robust database migration tool like Prisma Migrate\.
- __Process:__
	- Never modify database schemas manually in staging or production\.
	- Write migration scripts \(\.sql or generated via Prisma CLI\) for every schema change\.
	- Ensure migrations are reversible where possible \(Prisma Migrate handles this reasonably well, but complex data migrations might need manual down scripts\)\.
	- Test migrations thoroughly in a staging environment that mirrors production data structure before deploying to production\.
	- Run migrations as part of the deployment process \(e\.g\., in the CI/CD pipeline after deploying new code but before routing traffic\)\.
- __Data Migrations:__ For complex data transformations not handled by schema changes alone \(e\.g\., backfilling data, changing data formats\), write dedicated, idempotent scripts\. Run these carefully, potentially in batches, with monitoring\.

## __Multi\-Org / Multi\-Tenant Scaling__

- __Database Strategy:__ \(Referenced in 22\_Provisioning\_Automated\_Setup\.md\)
	- __Row\-Level Security \(RLS\):__ Good starting point, scales well for many use cases\. Requires careful policy implementation and indexing on tenant\_id\.
	- __Separate Schemas:__ Offers better isolation, potentially better performance for tenants with vastly different data sizes\. More complex management\.
	- __Separate Databases:__ Maximum isolation, highest cost/complexity\. Usually reserved for very large enterprise clients or specific compliance requirements\.
- __Application Layer:__ Ensure all database queries, cache keys, file storage paths, and background jobs are strictly scoped by tenant\_id\. Avoid cross\-tenant data leakage\.
- __Infrastructure:__ Design infrastructure \(load balancing, auto\-scaling, database replicas\) to handle growth in the number of tenants and the load within each tenant\. Monitor resource usage per tenant if possible\. \(See 12\_DevOps\_Infrastructure\.md\)\.

## __Vertical Integration & Future APIs__

- __Internal APIs:__ Structure backend logic into well\-defined internal services/modules with clear APIs between them, even if initially deployed as a monolith\. This facilitates potential future transitions to microservices if scale demands it\.
- __Public APIs:__ Design the Core Application API \(14\_Third\_Party\_Integrations\.md\) with future needs in mind \(versioning, clear documentation, potential for SDK generation\)\.
- __Consider GraphQL:__ Evaluate GraphQL as an alternative or supplement to REST for the Core Application API, especially if frontend or third\-party integrators require flexible data fetching capabilities\.
