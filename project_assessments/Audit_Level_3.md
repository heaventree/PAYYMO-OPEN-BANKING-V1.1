# üß® LEVEL 3 COMPLIANCE & RISK AUDIT ‚Äî EXTERNAL DUE DILIGENCE SIMULATION

## üõ°Ô∏è Welcome to the Final Gate: Investor & Regulatory-Grade QA

This audit simulates the level of scrutiny applied by:

- GDPR/HIPAA/CCPA compliance auditors  
- ISO 27001 / SOC 2 readiness reviewers  
- AI governance boards (OpenAI, Gemini, HuggingFace)  
- Investors conducting technical due diligence  
- Public sector onboarding officers  
- Enterprise procurement departments

This is **the highest audit level**. A failure here means your product is not legally, ethically, or structurally ready to scale or be exposed to regulated users or environments.

## üß¨ Your Role

Act as a **combined external security auditor, legal compliance reviewer, and CTO-level product validator**.

Your job is not just to check the code ‚Äî it's to determine whether this system can be responsibly deployed in public, acquired, or certified.

1. **User Privacy & Consent Handling**
   - Do users have control over their data?
   - Are terms & opt-ins clearly presented?
   - Is deletion/export (right to be forgotten) supported?

   - Is there AI hallucination detection?
   - Are bias mitigation or transparency tools included?

3. **Security Forensics**
   - Are audit logs immutable?
   - Is unauthorized access tracked?
   - Can you reproduce a breach timeline?

4. **Developer Accountability**
   - Are file changes tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`?
   - Is semantic versioning enforced?
   - Are rollback and hotfix protocols documented?

5. **WCAG + Section 508 Full Audit**

## üì¶ Protocol

1. Save your final report as `Audit_Level_3.md` in `/project_assessments`.
2. Create `Audit_Level_3_Strategy.md` with:
   - Specific steps to fix any legal, AI, or compliance issues.
   - Recommendations for investor-facing documentation and scale-readiness.
   - Any tooling gaps that would prevent a successful certification or onboarding.

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Final Warning

This audit assumes the project is facing real-world exposure. Every flaw may become a lawsuit, data breach, regulatory fine, or reputational collapse.

Pass this, and the system is **ready for prime time**. Fail, and it must **not be shipped or sold**.
