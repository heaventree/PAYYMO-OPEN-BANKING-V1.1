## Active Remediation Efforts

1. **Database Management**
   - Audit trail table implementation
   - Enhanced migration safety

2. **Error Handling**
   - Further enhancement of error context
   - Standardized error responses

3. **Security**
   - Secret management refinements
   - Certificate validation enhancements

## Next Priorities

1. **Testing & Validation**
   - Implement comprehensive testing framework
   - Create integration tests for banking services

2. **Security**
   - Complete GoCardless certificate management
   - Enhance API security measures

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Create user documentation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Area | Current Status | Mitigation Plan |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Secret Management | Using defaults in dev | Implement proper environment variables |
| Database Consistency | Mixed use of migrations | Enforce migration-only approach |
| GoCardless Integration | Sandbox mode | Complete certificate configuration |
| Multi-tenant Isolation | Basic implementation | Enhance tenant context security |

## Conclusion
Significant progress has been made in improving the code quality of the WHMCS-PAYYMO-OPEN-BANKING integration, particularly in the areas of database management, logging, and error handling. The implementation of proper service patterns and dependency management has also strengthened the architecture. 

While the estimated score has improved from 59 to 73, continued focus is needed on testing, documentation, and completing the security improvements to reach the target score of 95+. The next phase should prioritize the implementation of comprehensive testing and the completion of all security-related enhancements.
